# GS2ML
GameMaker Studio 2 Mod Loader based on [GMML](https://github.com/cgytrus/gmml)
(made because GMML is broken on newer GameMaker versions due to a change in how the exe is compiled.)

## Documentation
While documentation is a work in progress, it should have enough info here to get you started.

## To Do
- Finish documentation
- (MAYBE) find a way to do C# interop without having to hook into the exe and break every time the runtime updates like GMML did. Not sure if this is even possible, lmao.
